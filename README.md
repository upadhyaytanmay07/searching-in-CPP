## 📚 Theory  

Searching is the process of finding the location of a given element (called the **key**) in a collection of data.  

### 1. Linear Search  
- Traverses the array sequentially from the first element to the last.  
- Works on **unsorted or sorted arrays**.  
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**  

---

### 2. Binary Search  
- Works only on **sorted arrays**.  
- Repeatedly divides the search interval in half.  
- Time Complexity: **O(log n)**  

---

### 3. Jump Search  
- Works on **sorted arrays**.  
- Instead of checking every element, it jumps ahead by fixed steps (√n).  
- Once the block is found, it performs a linear search inside the block.  
- Time Complexity: **O(√n)**  

---

### 4. Interpolation Search  
- Works on **sorted and uniformly distributed arrays**.  
- Improves on binary search by estimating the position of the key using interpolation formula:  
  `pos = low + ((key - arr[low]) * (high - low)) / (arr[high] - arr[low])`  
- Time Complexity: **O(log log n)** (best case), **O(n)** (worst case if distribution is skewed).  

---

### 5. Fibonacci Search  
- Works on **sorted arrays**.  
- Uses Fibonacci numbers to divide the array into sections.  
- Similar to binary search but uses Fibonacci sequence to determine mid.  
- Time Complexity: **O(log n)**

## 📋 Algorithms  

### 🧾 Linear Search  
1. Start  
2. Input array and key.  
3. For each element from index 0 to n-1:  
   - If `arr[i] == key`, return index.  
4. If not found, print "Element not found".  
5. End  

---

### 🧾 Binary Search  
1. Start  
2. Input sorted array and key.  
3. Initialize `low = 0`, `high = n-1`.  
4. While `low <= high`:  
   - `mid = (low + high) / 2`  
   - If `arr[mid] == key`, return index.  
   - Else if `arr[mid] > key`, set `high = mid - 1`.  
   - Else set `low = mid + 1`.  
5. If not found, print "Element not found".  
6. End  

---

### 🧾 Jump Search  
1. Start  
2. Input sorted array and key.  
3. Set step = √n.  
4. Jump ahead in steps until `arr[min(step, n)-1] >= key`.  
5. Perform linear search in the block from `step/prev` to `step`.  
6. If found, return index; else print "Element not found".  
7. End  

---

### 🧾 Interpolation Search  
1. Start  
2. Input sorted, uniformly distributed array and key.  
3. Initialize `low = 0`, `high = n-1`.  
4. While `low <= high` and `key >= arr[low]` and `key <= arr[high]`:  
   - Compute `pos = low + ((key - arr[low]) * (high - low)) / (arr[high] - arr[low])`.  
   - If `arr[pos] == key`, return index.  
   - Else if `arr[pos] < key`, set `low = pos + 1`.  
   - Else set `high = pos - 1`.  
5. If not found, print "Element not found".  
6. End  

---

### 🧾 Fibonacci Search  
1. Start  
2. Input sorted array and key.  
3. Initialize Fibonacci numbers: `fibM = fib(k)`, `fibMm1 = fib(k-1)`, `fibMm2 = fib(k-2)`.  
4. While `fibM < n`, generate next Fibonacci number.  
5. Set offset = -1.  
6. While `fibM > 1`:  
   - `i = min(offset + fibMm2, n-1)`  
   - If `arr[i] < key`: shift Fibonacci numbers down by one, set offset = i.  
   - Else if `arr[i] > key`: shift Fibonacci numbers down by two.  
   - Else return index.  
7. If last element matches key, return index.  
8. Else print "Element not found".  
9. End

## 🚀 Applications  

- **Linear Search** → Small or unsorted datasets.  
- **Binary Search** → Large sorted datasets.  
- **Jump Search** → Sorted datasets where √n comparisons are acceptable.  
- **Interpolation Search** → Sorted, uniformly distributed datasets (e.g., phonebooks).  
- **Fibonacci Search** → Sorted datasets where division is costly (uses addition/subtraction).

## 🧠 Conclusion  

- **Linear Search** is simple but inefficient for large datasets.  
- **Binary Search** is efficient but requires sorted data.  
- **Jump Search** optimizes search by skipping blocks.  
- **Interpolation Search** is best for uniformly distributed data.  
- **Fibonacci Search** is an alternative to binary search that avoids division.  
- Together, these algorithms form the foundation of **searching techniques in DSA** and are widely applied in databases, operating systems, and real-time applications.
